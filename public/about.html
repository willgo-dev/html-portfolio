<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Willder Gomez, I'm from Venezuela and currently living in U.S. <br>
  I am very passionate about technology and especially programming, I like to experience different technologies and be updated with the latest developments in the area. I am very enthusiastic when I find a new topic of interest, whether personal or professional, I like passion to flow. If I am not familiar with some technology, I do a lot of research until I have the ability to do it, although sometimes it is easy for me to absorb knowledge simply by seeing it or trying it, I would say that it is one of my best skills as a person.
